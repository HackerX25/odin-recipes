    <p>Kenyan Chapati is a soft, flaky, chewy flatbread that is a staple part of celebratory meals in Kenya 
    <br>and other East African Countries. Popularly known as “chapo” in Kenya, it is usually enjoyed with curries 
    <br>as a main meal, with tea or eggs for breakfast. 
    <br>
    Kenyan Chapati is not the same as the Indian chapati. Indian chapati is also known as roti in many parts of India. Kenyan Chapati is more like the flaky parathas.</p>
